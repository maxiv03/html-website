        I'm a Junior Front-End Developer and a Glitch Art artist. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
        and I enjoy creating captivating user interfaces that bring designs to life. Collaborating with designers to implement
        their vision and ensuring a seamless user experience is something I find both challenging and rewarding.
    </p>
    <p>Aside from my programming skills, I'm also passionate about Glitch Art. I love exploring the digital realm and transforming images into visually striking and unconventional pieces. Embracing digital imperfections and pushing the boundaries of traditional art is where my creativity shines.</p>
    <p>Combining my expertise in front-end development and glitch art, I bring a unique perspective to my work. I approach web design with an artistic eye and a penchant for experimentation. My goal is to create innovative and visually stunning digital experiences that leave a lasting impact on users.</p>
